# quickCourse_RegEx
In this repository you will find instructions about hot to create and implement regular expressions.

## Purpose
The main purpose for the creation of this repository is to store code in different programming languages where you can apply data scraping techniques for identify patterns in a large amount of data. According to the site of [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) a regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters. So they are used to perform pattern-matching and "search-and-replace" functions on text. Bellow there is a image that illustrates the application of RegEx.
