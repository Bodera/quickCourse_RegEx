Lessons model:
    - Our lesson begins ... (here I tell the user story, the real-world scenario)

    - By the end of this lesson you will completely understand the meaning of the regex below:
        ```javascript
            (the regular expression that solves our case)
        ```
    - Then I go through the necessary knowledgment basis that are indispensable to finally realize how we can construct our own regular expression.
